# MineHunt
Android Game
Minehunt is a game based on a battlefield grid.
The player is in a cave and has to find the exit avoiding the hidden mines.

Everytime a block is mined an item can be revealed:
- mine: removes one lifepoint or the shield if it's present
- heart: restores 1 lifepoint (max 3)
- shield: protects from 1 explosion (max 1)
- coin: a gold coin that adds points to the final score if the game ends with a win
- skull: easter egg only present in hard mode, you are invincible in your next 5 mine actions, you acquire the status undead and you have no lifepoints, if you don't find the exit before it runs out you die from "undead curse"

There are 3 game modes:
- Easy: you start with 3 lifepoints, each coin gives you 1 score
- Normal: you start with 2 lifepoints, each coin gives you 2 scores, there are more mines than the "Easy" mode
- Hard: you start with 3 lifepoints, each coin gives you 3 scores, there are more mines than the "Normal" mode

You can unlock more skins with the score points in the skin selector section.
